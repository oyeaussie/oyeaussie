## Tech/Life Journey
- 1979 : Birth, f... me! Why? Anyhow...
- 1989 : Introduction to computer via the game hangman. That day I realized 2 things :

  2) I suck at spelling.<br>
  Till date it has remained the same... talk about consistency ;-)

- 1994 : Got 100% in computers test at school and barely passed in languages and maths. The unbreakable bond of me loving computers developed. Plus being an introvert, I didn't have to talk to other school students and spent most of time in the computer lab. Win win!

  1) Introduction to NT, Windows XP
  2) Introduction to dial up internet and annoying sound of modem negotiation :-) opened gateway to the world.
  3) First introduction to ICQ, started chatting with strangers around the globe.

- 2002 :
  1) MCSE, MCSA certifications.
  2) Introduction to Linux. LNA & LSA certification. Bye bye windows! Till date I use Linux everywhere, even for desktop, laptop, server, raspbery Pi, etc...

- 2020 :
  1) COVID!!!!!
  2) Life has been good, time to pass on!
  3) Stuck in India, living with mum and dad is nice, but bored to death, how many recepies can we try? Tiktok sucks!
  4) What to do... what to do????
  5) PHP seems interesting. I always wanted to learn programming. Maybe covid has given me the opportunity I was looking for.
  6) Change mindset to positive. Read PHP manual, write code, read docs, online forums, stackoverflow, watch online vidoes.
  7) write code... write code... write code...
  8) Introduction to different frameworks, laravel, wordpress, Phalcon, wait what? PHP extension written in C. Love it!
  9) Start development of a new framework ![SP](https://github.com/sp-framework/core) using Phalcon... still writing... whenever I get a change. Single dev, what do you expect huh?
- 2021 : Travel bug, travelled south, central, north, west coast of Australia driving 30k Kms. 
- 2023 : Customer duped me! Loss of finance and jobworks. Locked in India again, in a remote location, with my laptop and books! 2 options:
  1) See this event related to customer as a failure... or
  2) Is it an oppurtunity to learn more? Yes!
  
Write more code! Learn more! Read more! Happy life! ;-)
